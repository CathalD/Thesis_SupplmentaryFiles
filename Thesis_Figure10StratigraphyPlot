# This script will be used to develop figure 10, the stratigraphy plots for my thesis

# The input is from the Thesis_Github files downloaded from https://github.com/CathalD/Thesis_SupplmentaryFiles.git
# Download the zip file, unzip the data file and set the working directory to wherever the fiel is saved to

#The output is 4 graphs that will be saved in the working directory, here i set it to "Thesis_SupplmentaryFiles-main" from the github download
# 1-3 are plots for each core
# 4 is all the plots together, as showwn in figure 10

#For this code, it was saved in "downloads" straight from teh github repository, but this can be adjusted

setwd("~/Downloads/Thesis_SupplmentaryFiles-main")


# This will output a "PNG" file for a figure with 9 plots,
#3 plots for 3 cores showing the A) ash-free bulk density B) ACAR and C) C/N

# The dataset needs a specific layout, with each value having an associated parameter value
#Therefore, the dataset should be organized as follows
#Column 1-4: Sample site, Bottom depth of sample, middle depth of sample and Age Cal yr BP
#Columns 5-34 are composed of parameters and there values


#Required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(readr)
