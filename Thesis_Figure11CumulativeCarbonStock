# This script will write Figure 11 for my thesis "cumulative carbon stock"
# The output is a plot showing the cumulative carbon stock (kg m-2) as a function of age
# For 3 cores collected in a cedar swamp from the Herrel Preserve, Southern Ontario


# The input is the datafile Coredata2 from the Github repository
setwd("~/Downloads/Thesis_SupplmentaryFiles-main")

#Required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

#The dataset should be organized as follows (Same as stratigraphy data)

#Column 1-4: Sample site, Bottom depth of sample, middle depth of sample and Age Cal yr BP
#Columns 5-34 are composed of parameters and there values

#Its important the dataset that is organized such that parameter is a column, and beside each columns parameter
# has an assigned value for it. So for each sample, every parameter and value should be labelled in each row


#Step 1: import data

#Set working directory to where the Github download is saved, for me its in downloads
setwd("~/Downloads/Thesis_SupplmentaryFiles-main")

#Obtain DBcoredata2 dataset from the supplementary datafiles
dbdataset2 <- read_csv("Thesis_GitHub/DBcoredata2.csv")
view(dbdataset2)

# Subset data for each plot

for (i in 1:1) {
  ccstibble <- tibble(dbdataset2[1:82,1:4], dbdataset2[1:82,(i+16):(i+17)])#obtain the cumulative stock and ages data from dataset
}



#This Code is meant to rename the columns and to reverse the values of the y-axis
#This could probably be done in ggplot with "Scale-reverse" but anyway, here it is done by
#separating dataset into sites, then manually reversing the y with function "rev"
